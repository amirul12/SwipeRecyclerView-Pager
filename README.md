![Swipe Recycle Pager Demo](https://github.com/filippella/SwipeRecyclerView-Pager/blob/master/demo.gif)

This is a demonstration for a snappy recyclerview. Depending on user choice we can swipe or tap to focus an element into the center of the screen.

Hope you like it!

It can be further improved and added new functionality upon you request.

Thanks and you are welcomed to contact me through my email -> filippo.eng@gmail.com
